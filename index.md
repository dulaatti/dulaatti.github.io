**will**

"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is a **little moxie**!"

If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable, you'd probably be right._**

I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.

>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

>_"He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: VIVE L'IRLANDE!"_

1. Cut the cheese   
  Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.  

2. Slice the tomatoes  
  Be careful when holding the knife.  
  For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's      seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.


We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.


1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
  Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way    that you don't make a mess.  

 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.    
  Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy,  but if you are, clean it up!


##Exercise 2

>"Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

The initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and raised unanswered questions, causing implementations to both intentionally and accidentally diverge from the original version. This was addressed in 2014, when long-standing Markdown contributors released CommonMark, an unambiguous specification and test suite for Markdown."

Markdown Extra is a lightweight markup language based on Markdown implemented in PHP (originally), Python and Ruby. It adds features not available with plain Markdown syntax. Markdown Extra is supported in some content management systems such as Drupal and TYPO3.

Markdown Extra adds the following features to Markdown:

* Markdown markup inside HTML blocks
* Elements with id/class attribute
* "Fenced code blocks" that span multiple lines of code
* Tables
* Definition lists
* Footnotes
* Abbreviations


LiaScript is a Markdown dialect that was designed to create interactive educational content. It is implemented in Elm and TypeScript and adds additional syntax elements to define features like:

* Animations
* Automatic speech output
* Mathematical formulas **(using KaTeX)**
* ASCII art diagrams
* Various types of quizzes and surveys
* JavaScript is natively supported and can be attached to various elements, this way code fragments can be made executable and editable

    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
